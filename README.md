**This is a second-semester assignment using Java. **

Through my work on this project, I became familiar with 
the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming: encapsulation (data and implementation hiding), 
inheritance, and polymorphism. 
I delved deeper into inheritance and polymorphism (optimizing class hierarchies, polymorphic processing, superclass references and subclass objects,
type casting, dynamic method binding, final methods and classes, abstract classes and methods, and creating and using interfaces).
Also, I learned how to design using object-oriented programming: identifying and implementing relationships between classes, defining properties and functions of classes, and specifying interfaces.
